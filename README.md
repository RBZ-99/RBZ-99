### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 **I am Rushikesh B. Zawar**
 I am a student pursuing **Masters in Computer Vision** at **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)** (2023-2024). I have previously completed Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Biological Sciences at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus, India and partly at Harvard University.
 
**I am actively looking for internship opportunities!** 
 

**Experience**:


I have worked on **Deepfake detection** from **GANs, Diffusion, Faceswap,etc** methods and developed a novel a diffusion based detector and also deployed some models used in production at a startup.

I also work on **Continual Learning** in **Computer Vision** at **Harvard University**. 

I previously worked on **fraud detection** as an **Applied Scientist** at **Amazon**. 

My work at **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)** involved building a personalized assisted learning system.

My work at **CSIR-CEERI** involved developing a robust system that **detect anomalies in unbalanced data scenarios using GANs**

I have also worked at **Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (TIFR)** on the **cake-cutting and fair resource** allocation problem.


**Others**:

I received admissions from **Harvard University** and **CMU** to pursue my graduate studies

I have been selected as a **Khorana Scholar** in 2020. I was recently selected for the program of CMMRS 2021- SaarbrÃ¼cken(Germany) and also for ILDP+ start program at Hiroshima University.
